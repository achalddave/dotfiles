# Achal's Dotfiles

These are just my dotfiles. There's honestly nothing too interesting here. This
was uploaded more for syncing purposes than to display the files. Thanks for
visiting, though.

## Notes

* See the `setup` folder for setup information
* In general, `*_after` files are sourced after the files in this repo.
  `*_before` files are sourced before thefiles in this repo. So, for
  example, `~/.bashrc_after` is sourced after the `.bashrc` in this repo's
  root. `
